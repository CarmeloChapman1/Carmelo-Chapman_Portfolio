          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            My long-term vision is to become a well-rounded technologist who can move
            confidently between software engineering, data, and security. I want to be
            the kind of person who can understand the technical details, but also explain
            them clearly to people who don’t work in IT every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working inside a healthcare organization has shown me that technology is
            not just about writing code — it is about reliability, trust, and impact.
            When systems work, people get the care and information they need. My goal
            is to contribute to systems that matter, where the work I do helps real
            people in meaningful ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continue my career, I plan to keep learning new tools and approaches,
            but I also want to stay grounded in good communication, patience, and
            problem-solving. My vision is to grow into roles where I can both build
            solutions and help others understand and use them.
