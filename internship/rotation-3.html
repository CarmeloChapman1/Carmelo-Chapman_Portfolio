          <h2>Team &amp; Focus</h2>
          <p>
            In this rotation, I worked with the commercial enrollment processing team. The group
            supports open enrollment (OE) activities, vendor coordination, and the processing of
            member enrollment data so coverage remains accurate and timely.

          <h2>Problem-Solving Example</h2>
          <p>
            One situation that stands out was when a vendor did not respond to emails for several days.
            Instead of waiting indefinitely, I took the initiative to identify the correct contact and
            escalated the communication. This helped get the process moving again and reinforced how
            important it is to be proactive when timelines are involved.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This rotation pushed me to grow in my communication skills. I became more comfortable
            emailing people I had never met before, summarizing what was needed, and following up
            when something stalled. I also saw how even small tasks, like sending a clear email or
            submitting a job correctly, contribute to keeping enrollment data accurate for members.
